  <!--Line 8 was missing its .webp. Line 10 was missing the /images/ folder name. line 12 was missing the img in <img src> and was also missing the ending angle bracket,line 14 had src spelt wrong. I also changed the size for it to look better. Fixed both line 10 and line 14's alt title, instead of Html5 icon, it's now webdev icon.-->
